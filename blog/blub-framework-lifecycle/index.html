<ol>
<li>Blub framework is hacked together in a weekend. It is lean and mean, and solves all the problems of Blub domain.</li>
<li>Pre-Blub users look at Blub, think it&rsquo;s really cool but doesn&rsquo;t have any libraries, so they pass.</li>
<li>Blub framework is noticed by smart people, who begin building cool, interesting solutions with it.</li>
<li>Blub now has its own website and learning guides.</li>
<li>`${UNICORN_VIRAL_STARTUP}` adopts Blub, and now everyone pays attention.</li>
<li>The first Blub conference is held in San Francisco.</li>
<li>$BIG_COMPANY_HERE adopts Blub. Giant codebases are written in Blub. Papers are written about Blub. You can get a career in Blub.</li>
<li>Some users complain that apps written in Blub are too slow. Nobody pays attention.</li>
<li>Starry-eyed devs try to write lightweight replacements for Blub <em>(blu, lub, blub-lite, lite-blub, pblub)</em>, but they never seem to gain traction.</li>
<li>Blub now has its own extension / plugin ecosystem. Maybe even its own language, conveniently hidden in f&quot;{CURRENT_CONFIG_FORMAT}&quot;.</li>
<li>Devs now start to complain about Blub tooling (not Blub) being too heavyweight for their <code>format!(&quot;{} MacBook&quot;, TWO_YEARS_AGO)</code>. That doesn&rsquo;t stop Blub-standard from being the #1 starred project on Github.</li>
<li>Some startups start using Blub for <strong>Glorp</strong> domain. This horrifies Orange website viewers, but not enough of them to matter.</li>
<li>Blub now has its own International Standards Organization and Working groups. They mostly comprise bored megacorp employees trying to get their side projects into Blub.</li>
<li>Glorp domain becomes really important, so more devs start using Blub for Glorp domain. Even those that should know better.</li>
<li>Users lash out on #{CURRENT_SOCIAL_MEDIA} about slow products and unreliable service. Turns out Blub really only applied to Blub domain, not to Glorp domain. Oops!</li>
<li>People try to write new frameworks for Glorp, but their managers keep telling them &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reuse legacy code&rdquo; (aka. be fungible).</li>
<li><strong>Blubx</strong> emerges, an extension language for Blub that transpiles to Glorp. All your Blub code is automatically Blubx code.</li>
<li>Blubx takes the world by storm. People trip over themselves to write transpilers, minifiers, optimizers, linkers (aka. macroexpand) for Blubx.</li>
<li>$BIG_COMPANY_HERE adopts Blubx. Giant codebases are written in Blubx. Papers are written about Blubx. You can get a career in Blubx.</li>
<li>The cracks in Blubx start to show. Users complain that it is still too slow, devs complain that the transpilation process is too confusing.</li>
<li>Not to worry, Blubx now has a swath of consultants, ready to help you tidy up your codebase and optimize your Blubx code for Glorp. All for the low, low price of $300/h.</li>
<li>Finally having had enough, %SENIOR_DEV% quits <code>$PRONOUN</code> Blubx job, takes a 2 year sabbatical, and thinks to <code>$REFLEXIVE_PRONOUN</code>: How can we <em>really</em> solve the problems of the Glorp domain?</li>
<li>GOTO 1.</li>

<li>I hope this English lesson is the biggest takeaway from this article.</li>
<li>CURRENT_CONFIG_FORMAT of the day is JSON, but some people insist on writing in Yaml. Poor souls.</li>
<li>I considered a custom location for the first Blub conference, but honestly, where else would it be?</li>
<li>No Blub article is complete without <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">linking the source of all Blubs</a>.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try and guess what Blub is.</li>

<li>Blub gets taught at your local high school.</li>
<li>Blub&rsquo;s creator gets hired by Microsoft DevDiv.</li>
<li>Blub&rsquo;s creator makes a programming language that nobody cares about.</li>
<li>Blub&rsquo;s creator makes a programming language that many people care about.</li>
<li>Blub gets added to #{YOUR_FAVORITE_REPL_SITE}</li>
