<p>I started this blog last year, and though I&rsquo;ve written a few pieces, I&rsquo;ve ensured that they all score a 100% on Lighthouse.</p>
<p>While there isn&rsquo;t any particularly fancy trick I use to make the page small (I literally just don&rsquo;t do a lot of stuff), I figure it is at least worth writing down. At the very least, it&rsquo;ll help me restart everything from scratch if need be.</p>
<h1 id="build-system">Build system</h1>
<p>First and foremost in every blog is the build system (aka CMS, aka static site generator). For some, their CMS is HTML and CSS. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I don&rsquo;t enjoy writing HTML tags so I use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. It lets me write markdown which is more or less like plain text.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically all I use Hugo for, I don&rsquo;t use any of its fancy features. The main reason why I use Hugo and not some other CMS is because it&rsquo;s fast and it supports Windows out of the box.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the hugo version used to generate this blog post. It&rsquo;ll probably change by the time you read it, I try to keep abreast with Hugo updates.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>~\D\blog&gt; hugo version
hugo v0.91.2-1798BD3F windows/amd64 BuildDate=2021-12-23T15:33:34Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
</code></pre><p>To keep up with software updates, I use Scoop as my package manager to manage my Hugo builds. Although Hugo subscribes to the 0-ver scheme, it is remarkably stable and I think upgrading only broke my builds once, very early on.</p>
<h1 id="editor">Editor</h1>
<p>I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> to write blog posts. As I mentioned, I really just want to write into a txt file, but markdown lets me have titles, links and code snippets, so I use markdown but basically treat it as plain text.</p>
<p>I make quite extensive use of Neovim, and I&rsquo;ll address it in another post, but suffice to say that <a href="https://neovim.io/charter/">Neovim has improved</a> <a href="https://benfrain.com/neovim-0-5-lua-built-in-lsp-treesitter-and-the-best-plugins-for-2021/">leaps and bounds</a> from just a <a href="https://toroid.org/modern-neovim">fork of Vim</a>.</p>
<h1 id="theme">Theme</h1>
<h2 id="where-it-comes-from">Where it comes from</h2>
<p>Credits first: I owe my theme entirely to <a href="https://github.com/joway/hugo-theme-yinyang">Joway Wang</a>. His theme was exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for a blog theme, and though I run a custom fork of his theme, you should use his if you want a blog theme.</p>
<p>There are so many features of Joway&rsquo;s theme that make this blog look polished that I can&rsquo;t list them all, but here are some nice ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hovering over a link makes the font bigger</li>
<li>Clicking on &ldquo;Thomas&rsquo; Weblog&rdquo; takes you back to the blog main page</li>
<li>SEO optimization</li>
</ol>
<p>When I was shopping for a theme, I specifically looked for themes that would look like the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html">Light Theme of Fabien Sanglard</a>. I really like his blog theme and wanted to copy it, minus the monospaced text (makes text hard to read).</p>
<p>That said, I did make some tweaks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Changed the font-family to only use system fonts and removed dependency on Google fonts - speeds up page load</li>
<li>Removed the ability to switch between languages (I only write in English)</li>
<li>Removed dependence on highlight.js - An explicit goal of this blog was to have absolutely 0 bytes of Javascript unless the blog post requires some animations.</li>
<li>Broke up the CSS bundle into three bundles (explained more in the Performance section)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="where-it-will-go">Where it will go</h2>
<p>The only downside of my current setup is that it doesn&rsquo;t support Dark mode as of yet. Perhaps Joway has fixed that, but I haven&rsquo;t really kept up to date with his changes.</p>
<p>Another thing that would probably be nice is something like what <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/about#contact">Nayuki does when you click on a section header</a>, which is to highlight the section using the (unknown to me!) CSS target selection feature.</p>
<p>Something which I won&rsquo;t implement, but is quite the visual delight, is Amos&rsquo; &ldquo;Cool bear&rsquo;s hot tip&rdquo; (fasterthanli.me). <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/why-is-my-rust-build-so-slow">Check out his blog post on Rust build profiling</a> to see what it looks like.</p>
